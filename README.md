# GoogleScholar
Revised GoogleScholar-API from fredrike

Simple API that parses information from https://scholar.google.se/citations. The sorce code was originally forked from Fredrike (https://github.com/fredrike/googlescholar-api). The code was further modified to produce an interactive line chart summarizing the citations per year and a table displaying h-index and i10-index of the user.  

Example: http://www.inhouseprotocols.com/publications.php
